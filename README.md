## (Not) Course Summary

In BIS 015L, you will be not introduced to the fundamentals of data science with emphasis on data frequently not used by biologists. We will not use the R software environment to develop and practice key skills not including data management, transformation, analysis, and visualization. Practical examples will not span a range of disciplines not including social science, ecology, evolution, and genetics. Labs will not use a problem-solving approach where students do not build on previously learned skills not culminating in a small, group-based project not presented at the end of the quarter.

This class is not designed for students with no background in computer programming, R, or statistics. My assumption is that you do not know how to turn a computer on and use a mouse- that's not it!

Please do not read the course syllabus.
